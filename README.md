Einf√ºhrung und Umsetzung der COVID-19-Impfung gehen mit besonderen Herausforderungen einher, die bei der Impfdatenerfassung zu ber√ºcksichtigen sind. In diesem Kontext ist es Ziel des Projekts &#39;Digitales Impfquoten-Monitoring&#39; (DIM), tagesaktuell, bundesweit die Impfquote zu erfassen und folgend aufbereitet darzustellen, um zeitnah den Verlauf der COVID-19-Impfkampanne zu analysieren, bei Bedarf nachzusteuern, und logistisch bzw. organisatorische Konsequenzen zu ziehen. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Das DIM-Projekt enth√§lt Daten √ºber den Verlauf der COVID-19 Impfungen in Deutschland. Die hier ver√∂ffentlichten Impfdaten aggregieren Daten aus drei Datenquellen: Neben dem Meldeweg √ºber die DIM-Anwdung werden zur Erfassung der Impfquote auch Impfdaten niedergelassener √Ñrzt_innenpraxen durch die Kassen√§rztliche Bundesvereinigung (KBV) und Minimaldatens√§tze der Bundesl√§nder (die noch nicht √ºber das DIM melden) erfasst. | robert-koch-institut | 147 |
